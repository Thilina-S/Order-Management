# Spring Boot Microservices Project â€“ Product, Inventory & Order System

This project is a **backend-focused microservices application** built with **Spring Boot**, demonstrating a **secure, scalable, and event-driven architecture**. The system is designed for practicing **distributed systems, service discovery, token-based authentication, asynchronous messaging, and monitoring**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The application consists of **three core microservices**:

- **Product Service**  
  Stores product details: `productId`, `name`, `price`, `expiryDate`, and `forSale` (1 = available, 0 = not for sale).  

- **Inventory Service**  
  Maintains stock levels: `itemId`, `productId`, `category`, `quantity`.  

- **Order Service**  
  Handles customer orders and validates:
  - Product availability (`forSale` flag) from Product Service
  - Stock quantity from Inventory Service

### ðŸ”‘ Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot** â€“ Each microservice is an independent Spring Boot application.
- **API Gateway** â€“ Central entry point for all requests, handles routing, load balancing, and token validation.
- **Keycloak** â€“ Authentication and authorization using **OAuth2 / JWT tokens**.
- **Netflix Eureka** â€“ Service registration and discovery for dynamic inter-service communication.
- **Apache Kafka** â€“ Event-driven communication between microservices (e.g., order notifications, inventory updates).
- **Prometheus & Grafana** â€“ Metrics collection and visualization for monitoring microservice health.
